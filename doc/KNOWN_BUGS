Debug: mail from: <Foobar verkkokauppa <iku@openbsd.fi>>
Debug: rcpt to: <Foo Bar <iku@openbsd.fi>>
Debug: rcpt to: <Bar <iku@openbsd.fi>>

type = 'normal'

You will get two normal mails, but both have the same To-header.
Instead it should have two normal mails, but with a To-header looking
like this:

To: Foo Bar <iku@openbsd.fi>,Bar <iku@openbsd.fi>

Conclusion: rcpt to works correctly although it could distinguish
same recipient and mail only once, and that To-header is the buggy
part.
